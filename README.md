<h1>Django CRUD Project</h1>

<p>This repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the Django web framework. This project serves as a basic template for creating and managing data records in a Django application.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Django CRUD project is designed to demonstrate how to perform the fundamental database operations using Django. It includes the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create: Add new records to the database.</li>
  <li>Read: Retrieve and display records from the database.</li>
  <li>Update: Modify existing records in the database.</li>
  <li>Delete: Remove records from the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project uses Django's built-in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the database and provides a user-friendly interface for managing data.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):</strong> It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional):</strong> Activate the virtual environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Install Dependencies:</strong> Install the project's dependencies using pip.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply Database Migrations:</strong> Apply the database migrations to create the necessary database tables.  </li>
  <li><strong>Run the Development Server:</strong> Start the Django development server.</li>
  <li><strong>Access the Application:</strong> Open a web browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a> to access the CRUD application.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once the project is up and running, you can use the web interface to perform CRUD operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Click the "Create" button to add a new record to the database.</li>
  <li><strong>Read:</strong> View a list of existing records by clicking the "Read" button.</li>
  <li><strong>Update:</strong> Edit the details of an existing record by clicking the "Edit" button.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove a record from the database by clicking the "Delete" button.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project can serve as a starting point for building more complex Django applications with CRUD functionality.</p>
